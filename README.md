Remember the Coursera Honor Code!

Try and get at least a working code by yourself. You can refer to this after you have tried once!

Once you are done with the submission, you can use these instructions to download your work : https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/360004990332-Download-Jupyter-Workspace-files
